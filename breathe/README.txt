Can't Breathe

------------------------------------------------------------
The surprisingly difficult process of making an LED breathe.
------------------------------------------------------------

As a break from the large-system, high-level programming that I usually do, I've been teaching
myself to program microcontrollers.

Just use `sin()`

Hold on there buck.


Scale to Eye's Responsiveness

natural exponential function y = ex

* LED either on or off.
* Flickering (Keep > 100Hz)
* Brightness proportional to 1/on_time


increment threshold - is in a constant relationship with the intensity level I, i.e.

ΔI/I=constant         (161)

The value of ΔI/I, called Weber fraction, constant, or ratio, varied with the type of physiological response; for brightness response, the initial values varied somewhat from one experiment to another (1/64 Bouguer 1760, 1/100 Weber 1834, 1/38 Steinheil 1837,  1/100 Fechner 1858), but it appeared constant, and the value variations were ascribed to different techniques used and/or to variations in individual sensitivities. More recent experiments came to the ratio values specific for the two main types of retinal photoreceptors, ~0.14 and 0.015-0.03 for the cones and rods, respectively (FIG. 237).
